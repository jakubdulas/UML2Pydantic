# UML to Pydantic Code Generator

This Python script converts UML class and enumeration diagrams into Pydantic class definitions. It uses regular expressions to parse UML diagrams and generate Pydantic code from them. This README provides an overview of the script and how to use it.

## Installation

You can use this script by simply copying and pasting it into your Python project. There are no external dependencies required.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Import the required modules at the beginning of your Python script:

   ```python
   import re
   ```

2. Define your UML models as a string.

3. Call the `generate_pydantic_classes_from_uml` function with your UML models string as an argument. This function will return the Pydantic code as a string.

4. You can then save the generated Pydantic code to a Python file or use it in your project as needed.

## Input

The input to this script should be a string containing UML class and enumeration diagrams. The script uses regular expressions to extract class definitions, relationships, and enumerations from this input.

## Output

The script generates Pydantic class definitions based on the input UML diagrams. The output is a Python code string that defines Pydantic classes and enumerations. You can use this code in your Python projects to work with data that conforms to the UML specifications.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```python
uml_models_str = """
class Car {
  numberOfDoors: int
  brand: string
}

class ElectricCar {
}

class ElectricMotor {
  +outputKW: float
}

 
Car <|-- ElectricCar

ElectricCar *-- "*" ElectricMotor
"""

pydantic_code = generate_pydantic_classes_from_uml(uml_models_str)

# Use pydantic_code in your project as needed.
```

In this example, the `uml_models_str` variable contains UML class and enumeration diagrams. Calling `generate_pydantic_classes_from_uml` with this input generates Pydantic code.
